# AdePT LLAMA examples for ACAT22

This repository provides examples using [AdePT](https://github.com/apt-sim/AdePT)
and [LLAMA](https://github.com/alpaka-group/llama)
which provided the basis for our contribution to the [ACAT22](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1106990/) workshop.
The slides of our talk are available [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1106990/contributions/4991259/).
